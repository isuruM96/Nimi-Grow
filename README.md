* How to run your application ?

    npm run client- runs only the ecommerce-app(frontend)
    npm run server - runs only the backend
    npm run dev - runs both backend and front end same time.
  
  
    first clone the repository then go to the file directory and cmd type npm install ,then go to the ecommerce-app folder here also run npm install command. then we can run concurrently both frontend and backend using above command. 
  
  
  
  
* Your choice of technology and the reasons for using them (and any alternatives you considered) 

   I am using this MERN stack for develop this application
   M- MongoDB (for database)
   E-expressJs (for backend )
   R-reactJs (for frontend)
   N- nodejs (for backend)
   
   why i choose MERM stack?
   
   It's Open Source. Each and every technology within Mean Stack uses JavaScript which is an open-source language.
   It Uses Single Language.
   It's Flexible & Efficient. 
   It's Scalable. 
   It's Easy to Implement. 
   It's User-friendly. 
   It's Isomorphic. 
   It's Developer-friendly.
